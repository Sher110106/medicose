# Expiry Date Reader: A Computer Vision Solution for the Visually Impaired

The Visionary Hackathon presents an exciting opportunity to develop impactful computer vision applications that can truly make a difference. After careful analysis of the competition requirements, prize categories, and implementation timeline, I believe an "Expiry Date Reader" application for the visually impaired represents your strongest chance of winning as a top contender. This solution directly targets the "Accessibility Hero" category while also having sufficient real-world impact to compete for the "Visual Intelligence Master" prize. This comprehensive roadmap outlines the concept, implementation strategy, and timeline to develop this solution within the remaining hackathon period.

## Project Concept: Empowering Visually Impaired Users

The Expiry Date Reader will leverage computer vision technology to help visually impaired individuals independently identify product expiration dates – a daily challenge highlighted by accessibility hackathons like the one organized by the Swiss Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired[5]. The application will use Nebius Studio's vision models to detect, recognize, and read aloud expiration dates from product packaging, significantly enhancing autonomy for users with visual impairments.

This solution addresses a genuine need: visually impaired individuals often struggle to identify critical information on product packaging, including expiration dates, which can lead to consumption of expired products or unnecessary waste of still-good items. By automatically determining expiry dates of products, this application provides immediate practical value in daily life activities like grocery shopping and kitchen management[5].

### Why This Will Be a Top Contender

The Expiry Date Reader targets the intersection of real-world impact and technical feasibility within the limited hackathon timeline. With Nebius's powerful vision models and text-to-image capabilities, you can develop a functional prototype that demonstrates immediate value while showcasing the platform's capabilities. Additionally, accessibility solutions have strong emotional appeal during judging, as they demonstrate technology being applied to improve lives meaningfully.

## Technical Architecture

The Expiry Date Reader will utilize a straightforward yet effective technical architecture built entirely on Nebius Studio:

### Computer Vision Component

The core of the application will use Nebius's vision-language models for image processing and text recognition. Specifically, I recommend leveraging Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct for this application, as it offers a good balance between performance and efficiency[1]. This model will:

1. Process images of product packaging captured through a camera
2. Identify and isolate text regions that may contain date information
3. Apply specialized pattern recognition to identify expiration date formats (which can vary significantly between products)
4. Extract the date information for conversion to speech

### Natural Language Processing Component

Once the expiration date is identified, the application will:

1. Format the date information in a user-friendly manner
2. Generate appropriate contextual messages (e.g., "This product expires on March 20, 2025" or "Warning: This product expired 5 days ago")
3. Convert this text to speech output

### User Interface

The interface should be exceptionally accessible, following guidelines for visually impaired users:

1. High-contrast, simple design with large touch targets
2. Voice-guided interaction allowing hands-free operation
3. Haptic feedback to confirm actions
4. Minimal required user input – ideally just pointing the camera at the product

## Technical Implementation Details

### Nebius Studio Configuration

First, set up your environment with Nebius Studio:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from llama_index.multi_modal_llms.nebius import NebiusMultiModal
from llama_index.core.multi_modal_llms.generic_utils import load_image_urls

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
NEBIUS_API_KEY = os.getenv("NEBIUS_API_KEY")

# Initialize the multimodal model
mm_llm = NebiusMultiModal(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct",
    api_key=NEBIUS_API_KEY,
    max_new_tokens=300,
)
```

### Expiration Date Detection Function

Create a specialized function to detect expiration dates:

```python
def detect_expiry_date(image_path):
    # Load the image
    image_documents = load_image_urls([image_path])
    
    # Prompt engineering for expiration date detection
    prompt = "Look carefully at this product packaging image. Identify and extract any expiration date, best before date, or use-by date. Return ONLY the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. If no date is found, return 'No expiration date detected'."
    
    # Query the vision model
    response = mm_llm.complete(
        prompt=prompt,
        image_documents=image_documents
    )
    
    # Process the response to extract and validate the date
    # (Additional date validation and formatting code would go here)
    
    return processed_date, confidence_score
```

### User Interface Implementation

For the user interface, prioritize accessibility using a framework that supports screen readers:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
import cv2
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
import pyttsx3

class ExpiryDateReaderApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Expiry Date Reader")
        self.root.geometry("800x600")
        
        # Initialize text-to-speech engine
        self.tts_engine = pyttsx3.init()
        
        # Set up the camera frame
        self.camera_frame = ttk.Frame(root)
        self.camera_frame.pack(pady=10)
        
        # Camera display
        self.camera_display = ttk.Label(self.camera_frame)
        self.camera_display.pack()
        
        # Capture button with large text and high contrast
        self.capture_btn = ttk.Button(
            root, 
            text="CAPTURE IMAGE",
            command=self.capture_image,
            style="Large.TButton"
        )
        self.capture_btn.pack(pady=20)
        
        # Results display with large text
        self.results_var = tk.StringVar()
        self.results_var.set("Point camera at product expiration date and press CAPTURE")
        self.results_label = ttk.Label(
            root, 
            textvariable=self.results_var,
            font=("Arial", 18)
        )
        self.results_label.pack(pady=10)
        
        # Initialize camera
        self.init_camera()
        
        # Set up accessible styles
        self.setup_accessible_styles()
        
        # Voice instructions on startup
        self.speak("Welcome to Expiry Date Reader. Point your camera at a product and press the large button at center screen to capture.")
    
    def setup_accessible_styles(self):
        # Create accessible high-contrast styles
        style = ttk.Style()
        style.configure(
            "Large.TButton",
            font=("Arial", 20, "bold"),
            foreground="white",
            background="blue",
            padding=20
        )
    
    def init_camera(self):
        # Initialize camera code would go here
        pass
    
    def capture_image(self):
        # Camera capture and processing code
        self.speak("Processing image. Please wait.")
        
        # This would call our detect_expiry_date function
        # expiry_date, confidence = detect_expiry_date(captured_image_path)
        
        # For demo purposes
        expiry_date = "2025-05-20"
        
        # Update display and speak result
        result_text = f"Expiration date: {expiry_date}"
        self.results_var.set(result_text)
        self.speak(result_text)
    
    def speak(self, text):
        # Use text-to-speech to read text aloud
        self.tts_engine.say(text)
        self.tts_engine.runAndWait()
```

## Testing and Validation

To ensure your application works effectively:

1. Test with diverse product packaging (food items, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics)
2. Evaluate performance under different lighting conditions
3. Test with various date formats (MM/DD/YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY, textual dates)
