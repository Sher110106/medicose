## The Problem

For millions of people with visual impairments, managing medications safely is a daily challenge:

- **Reading small print** on medicine packaging is difficult or impossible
- **Identifying expiration dates** is crucial for safety but often printed in tiny, low-contrast text
- **Distinguishing between similar-looking medications** can lead to dangerous mix-ups
- **Accessing important medication information** like dosage, warnings, and side effects requires assistance
- **Tracking multiple medications** becomes increasingly complex, especially for elderly patients

These challenges lead to medication errors, reduced independence, and potential health risks for visually impaired individuals.
